# Studying effect on binary symmetric channel(BSC) on bit error rate (BER)
# Part_1: Changing the value of p and calculate BER at frequency samplig fs = 1
# Part_2: Changing the value of fs to 5 and calculate BER at different probabilities p
# Part_3: Making the channel correlated and study its effect same as part 1
# Part_4: Changing the fs and caclualte the BER at p = 0.2
First read the pdf to know the required tasks and then run the matlab code to draw your own conclusions and finally read the word file to check your conclusions or improve mine.
